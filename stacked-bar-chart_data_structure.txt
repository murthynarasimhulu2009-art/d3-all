Explanation  
- category is a categorical (nominal) field used for the x‑axis band scale.  
- series is a nominal field that determines the color and the stack order.  
- value is the quantitative measurement that drives the height of each stack segment.  
- y0 and y1 are generated by the `stack` transform; they define the start and end positions of each rectangle on the y‑axis (the lower and upper bounds of the stacked bar).  

The original inline data contains the fields `category`, `series1`, `series2`, `series3`. After the `stack` transform, each original row is expanded into three rows (one per series) and the fields above (`category`, `series`, `value`, `y0`, `y1`) become the final data structure used by the chart.
