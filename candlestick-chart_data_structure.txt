Explanation of fields:
- date – temporal identifier used for the x‑axis (band scale).  
- open – quantitative value; used to compute the rectangle height and color (compare with close).  
- high – quantitative; defines the top of the wick line (y2).  
- low – quantitative; defines the bottom of the wick line (y).  
- close – quantitative; defines the top of the candle body (y) and also used for color (green if close > open, else red).  
- volume – quantitative; present in the data but not used in the current visual encoding.  

The chart expects a flat array named main (as referenced by the scale’s `domainFrom`), with each object containing the fields listed above. No nested structures such as nodes or links are present.
